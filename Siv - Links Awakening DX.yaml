  # [Normal] Playable without using any tricks or glitches. Can require knowledge from a vanilla playthrough, such as how to open Color Dungeon.
  # [Hard] More advanced techniques may be required, but glitches are not. Examples include tricky jumps, killing enemies with only pots.
  # [Glitched] Advanced glitches and techniques may be required, but extremely difficult or tedious tricks are not required. Examples include Bomb Triggers, Super Jumps and Jesus Jumps.
  # [Hell] Obscure knowledge and hard techniques may be required. Examples include featherless jumping with boots and/or hookshot, sequential pit buffers and unclipped superjumps. Things in here can be extremely hard to do or very time consuming.
